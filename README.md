**Predicting Employee Promotion Utilizing Logistic Regression**

Forecasting whether an employee will receive a promotion is pivotal for organizations to make well-informed HR decisions. Within this endeavor, we utilize logistic regression to construct a predictive model aimed at estimating the probability of employee promotions, leveraging a variety of features.

Outcomes

Upon training the logistic regression model, we assess its efficacy through metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
